## Introduction
React Native allows you to create truly native apps and doesn't compromise on your users' experience. It provides a core set of platform-agnostic native components like `View`, `Text`, and `Image` that map directly to the platformâ€™s native UI building blocks.

## Getting Started
To get started with React Native, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Install React Native CLI**: Run `npm install -g react-native-cli` to install the React Native CLI.
3. **Initialize a New Project**: Use `react-native init ProjectName` to create a new React Native project.
4. **Run the Project**: Navigate to your project directory and run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` to start the application.
